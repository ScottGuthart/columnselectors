Column selectors are react components which allow you to group a large list of items easily.

The demo site above allows you to upload an excel file and group the columns.

The site uses a flask api to get the column names. react-bootstrap is also used along with react-icons which make it a good starter template if you plan on creating your own app that uses these things.
